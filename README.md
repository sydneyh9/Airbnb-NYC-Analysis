Tools Used: 
- Microsoft Excel (Data Cleaning)
- Tableau (Analysis, Visualizations)

Description: An analysis of 2019 Airbnb listings and hosts in NYC by price, neighborhood, reviews, and room type.

Notes: This analysis was done entirely in Tableau. While I've used the visualization tool for case studies in the past, I challenged myself to derive significant insights from data utilizing only the various visualizations I could create in Tableau.
